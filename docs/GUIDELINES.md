### Contributing Assets and Work to Luke Ken 3D 

Before you submit anything, please keep in mind that the work you contribute will be added to the project under the BSD License, until the maintainers decide to remove it and place over at left over vault. If you're okay with that and fine with receiving credit, you're good to go. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the maintainers or consult the license for more information. 

Intellectual property we know people hate legalese, but this is important. This applies to
**everything** which is submitted.

Here are some general guidelines for contributing assets to the Luke Ken 3D project:

1. All assets must be original work or released under a compatible open-source license such as CC0. Assets that are copied or derived from copyrighted material are not allowed.
2. When creating new assets such as art, try to capture the art style of game assets as was back then closely as possible with 3D render or artwork. Do not try to emulate resources exactly or make mirror clones of it. Where possible, put effort to make them look visibly different and replace it as such. The design to be cosmic futuristic 90's sci-fi theme.

3. When designing content keep this info in mind 
A. Art assets should be in the PNG format with transparency where appropriate. You will need baffed to test them.
B. Sound assets should be in the .flac high bitrate you can set for gold masters, at minimum for legacy wav/voc 8-bit 2205hz. 
C. Music should be in .mid also the music will not play if the .MID file excedes 72000 bytes.

4. Other formats may be accepted, but they should be discussed with the project maintainers first. Before submitting new assets, make sure that they are properly named and organized. Use clear and concise names that accurately describe the contents of each asset. Make sure that they are organized in a logical folder structure.
5. Make sure that any new assets do not break compatibility with the vanilla game. This means that they should have the same dimensions, color palettes, and other technical specifications as the original assets. Resizing GFX way to large with would brake alignment, fill up the screen and big as they appear, or make the sprite or art look too out place then norrmal size. Keep this in mind while working on them. Just make it friendly for 486 computers. lol!
6. When submitting new assets, provide a clear description of what they are and how they are intended to be for. 
7. If you are making a large contribution or adding a something new that alter the flow of the project, it is recommended that you discuss your plans with the project maintainers and project owner first to make sure that they are in line with the goals of the project. 
8. All asset contributions will be reviewed by the project maintainers before they are merged into the main branch. If there are any issues or concerns with the contributions, the maintainers will work with the contributor to resolve them.
9. When making levels for the project make them basic and interesting as possbile with some secrets help the player progress on. When comes to secret levels you may use open source level layout from other games such as freedoom for example as easter egg or just normmal level out of heart. Keep in the vanilla limits of the game for compatibility so don't brake under DOS. Make sure they play well in singleplayer and mulitplayer. Keep the skill level less extreme more fair to the player best as possbile. 

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that your asset contributions are of high quality and are compatible with the goals of the Luke Ken 3D project.

**Reporting Non-Compliant Assets**

We are dedicated to maintaining a fully open-source environment for our project, Luke Ken. As part of our commitment to using free and open assets, the majority of the assets we employ are sourced from the public domain or under the Creative Commons CC0 license. Additionally, we create many assets from scratch to ensure their compliance with open-source standards.

However, if you come across any assets within our project that do not fully adhere to the open-source guidelines, or if you suspect there might be an oversight in licensing, we encourage you to report them to us. Your assistance in identifying any non-compliant assets is invaluable in upholding the principles of open-source development.

Please inform us by reporting this as issue request on our GitHub tracker, which will enable us to promptly address and rectify any potential licensing discrepancies. Your proactive involvement plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of our project and sustaining its open nature.

Thank you for your cooperation and support in making Luke Ken 3D a truly open-source endeavor.
